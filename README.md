# flask-docker-redis-api

This project is a simple **Flask REST API** that counts visits using **Redis**. Containerized with **Docker**, it offers an easy-to-deploy, scalable example of combining Flask, Redis, and Docker for lightweight web services.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on containerizing a simple Flask application that uses Redis to store a visit counter. The core emphasis is on writing an efficient `Dockerfile` and orchestrating multiple containers using **Docker Compose**.

---

## 🐳 Dockerfile Implementation

The `Dockerfile` is designed to set up a lightweight Python environment, install necessary dependencies, and prepare the Flask app to run within a container.  

**Key implementation details:**
- ✅ Utilize an official slim Python base image to minimize container size.  
- ✅ Define a working directory inside the container for organized file management.  
- ✅ Copy the dependency file (`requirements.txt`) and install required Python packages using pip.  
- ✅ Add the application code into the container image.  
- ✅ Expose the appropriate port to make the Flask app accessible externally.  
- ✅ Specify the container’s startup command to run the Flask application correctly.  

This approach ensures **optimized layering in Docker**, improving build speed and efficient use of image caching.

## ⚙️ Docker Compose Implementation

To manage both the Flask app and its Redis dependency, a `docker-compose.yml` configuration is included. This enables orchestration of multiple containers with ease.  

**Key components:**
- 📦 Define multiple services — one for the Flask app and another for Redis.  
- 🔑 Configure environment variables in the Flask service for connectivity to Redis.  
- 🌐 Map container ports to host ports for local access and testing.  
- ⏳ Establish service dependencies so the Flask app waits for Redis to initialize properly.  
- 🪶 Use lightweight official images (e.g., Redis Alpine) for optimized resource usage.  

With Docker Compose, deployment and management of the application stack is simplified to a single command.

## 📖 Summary

This project demonstrates practical implementation of:  
- 🛠 Building optimized Docker images for Python applications.  
- 📝 Crafting clear and efficient Dockerfiles balancing simplicity and performance.  
- 🔗 Defining multi-service applications using Docker Compose.  
- 🔄 Managing service interdependencies and communication in containerized environments.  

These practices form a strong foundation for developing **scalable, production-ready containerized applications** and deploying microservices effectively.
